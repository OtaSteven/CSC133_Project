# CSC133_Project



In this project, I developed a game where the objective of it is to be able to use a helicopter to 'seed' the clouds by pressing SPACE. Upon 'seeding' the cloud(s),
the pond(s) that are near the clouds will begin to increase it's capacity. Once all three ponds have an average of 80% capacity, the player can make its way back to the
landing pad to land the helicopter and the win condition will appear! But be aware that if the helicopter runs out of fuel before then, the player will automatically
lose.
